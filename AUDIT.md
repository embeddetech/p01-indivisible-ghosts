# How these papers are audited

Every manuscript in this program is written by an AI (Claude Fable 5,
Anthropic), directed and reviewed by a human author who is an engineer,
not a physicist. That provenance is disclosed on page 2 of every paper.
This document describes the quality gate each paper must pass before it
circulates, so that "audited" is a checkable claim rather than a vibe.
The complete pass-by-pass ledger for each paper — every finding, every
fix, every counter state — is preserved in `histories/` in the program's
main repository.

## The release gate

No paper circulates until it has accumulated **K = 3 consecutive
fully-clean audit passes**. K began at 2; the standing escalation
clause — if any error is ever caught after a pass was declared clean,
by a later pass, a reader, or post-release, K rises for all subsequent
releases — fired on 2026-07-13 (a pass-8 audit found issues present
during a declared-clean pass 7), and the program accepted the
escalation rather than weakening the clause. It remains standing.

**A pass** is a full audit cycle by **three fresh AI agents** working
independently, with no access to any prior audit report (to prevent
anchoring on previously-cleared claims):

1. **Claims/proofs auditor** — reads the manuscript as a hostile
   referee and independently re-derives every theorem, lemma, and
   proposition from scratch, probing specifically for false converses,
   overstated quantifiers, and claims filed above their delivered
   strength (theorem-grade vs computed vs sampled vs asymptotic vs
   conjectural).
2. **Numerics auditor** — re-runs every public script in full and
   traces **every number in the manuscript** (abstract included) to a
   script output line, a re-verified in-text derivation, or a cited
   source, with robustness spot-checks (perturbed tolerances, refined
   grids, changed seeds where seed-robustness is claimed).
3. **Bibliography/prior-art auditor** — verifies every reference
   field-by-field against primary records (for journal-led citations
   the publisher record governs, not the arXiv preprint), checks every
   quotation verbatim against its source, checks every characterization
   of cited work for fairness, and runs fresh adversarial searches
   attempting to *refute* the paper's novelty claims.

**Clean** means zero findings requiring a change to the manuscript or
scripts — any severity, including style nits. Pure no-action
observations do not count. **Any fix resets the counter to zero.**
Factual corrections proposed by an auditor (an author name, a title, a
number attributed to an external source) are independently verified
against the primary source *before* being applied — the corrector can
be as wrong as the original, and this program has caught auditors'
corrections being reversed by stronger primary evidence.

## Cross-model verification

The papers are authored by one model family and audited by agents from
two (Claude Fable and Claude Opus), in varied framings across passes
(checklist verification, fresh-eyes reading, skeptical-referee,
regression). The final confirming pass before release is run at
release grade. In practice the two architectures have independently
re-derived every theorem in the corpus multiple times each.

## The failure-mode checklist

Audits are aimed, not generic. Each pass explicitly probes a checklist
of failure modes grown from errors this program actually caught in its
own work (each entry exists because the generic read-through missed it
at least once):

- false "iff"s and converse claims;
- manuscript claims stronger *or weaker* than what the code proves;
- chimera citations (one entry fusing two real papers), paraphrases
  drifted into quotation marks, preprint titles cited for published
  versions;
- claims of exactness where the artifact shows machine epsilon;
- tolerance-masked numerics (ill-conditioned inverses, grid
  coarseness) — key checks re-run under perturbed settings;
- half-domain scans generalized to full-domain claims;
- conclusions written before the data (pre-run-expectation
  contamination) — predictions are pre-registered in the notebook and
  their failures logged;
- incomplete fix propagation — a corrected constant is grepped across
  all scripts, companion papers, and documentation;
- Monte-Carlo "resolved to ±X" claims not backed by a printed
  truth-vs-estimate correlation (a spread alone can be an echo of the
  injected prior);
- convention-relative quantities stated as convention-free;
- prior-art staleness — fast-moving lanes are re-swept.

## What this is and is not

This gate is the program's pre-circulation quality bar. It is not a
substitute for human peer review — it is the reason the papers are fit
to ask for it. Every theorem carries a full proof, every numerical
claim is reproducible from the public scripts, and the audit ledgers
are public precisely so that a human referee can start from the
program's own record of what has been checked, what was found, and
what was fixed. The notebooks also keep an errors-and-misses ledger:
the program records its own failures, including the ones its audits
took multiple rounds to catch.
